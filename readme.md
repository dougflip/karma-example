A very small project to show a simple [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html) setup

## Pre-reqs

- Make sure [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) is installed
    - on OSX I was using [n](https://github.com/visionmedia/n) and on Windows I am using [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist)

## Getting Started

From the root of the project:

- `npm install` to get dependencies
- `npm test` to run karma
